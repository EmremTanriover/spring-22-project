For the question that is asked in the manual of the project, I was not able to code the p-median heuristic because of my coding skills even if I tried.
However, I know that if we change the size of the problem, it affects the complexity and affects the cpu time. So that even I was not able to run the code,
from my knowledge that I gained from this course, I expect running the code for P=10, takes more time than running the code for P=3.
